Is there a place on the opening page to call attention to a new interview, review, or some other piece of news? Just a brief click through? Click here to see the Wall Street Journal review… Click here to go John F. Ross’s interview on National Geographic….

John F. Ross on the hazards of early flight.

John F. Ross on Rickenbacker’s hair-raising escapades in early car racing.

Is there a way of putting one of these on the front page? It’s pretty cool to be given an option to click on a video. A smallish screen?

Still interested in getting my picture perhaps above the menu, or definitely up higher.

Can you correct the spelling of “accomplished” in the Brinkley quote above the menu?
